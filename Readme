Output files for all transition states, minima, and IRC calculations presented in the thesis are located here. 
These are  named with a prefix indicating the type of file - "Minimum_" for an optimization, corresponding with the lowest energy geometry of the respective complex determined (Note that comformational space of some of these intermediates has not been completely explored) "IRC" for an intrinsic reaction coordinate calculation, "IRC_ReactantComplex" or "IRC_ProductComplex" for an optimization done at the stopping point of an IRC calculation, and "TS_" for a transition state
The relevant reaction is labelled with reactants and products. In cases where multiple mechanisms exist for a reaction with the same reactants and products, the mechanism is specified. ie. "TS_1Q0_and_EG_to_1QmL_and_water"
Silicate-polyol complexes are represented using a form analogous to conventional silicate-polyol notation, as outlined in the thesis. Q, P, or H, denotes a 4-, 5-, or 6-coordinated complex, respectively. The number to the left of this value gives the overall charge of the species. The binding of the ligand is denoted with b for bidentate or m for monodentate. Ie., QbLmL is a 4-coordiante complex with one monodentate and one bidentate ligand
To distinguish calculations involving mannitol as a ligand, "Mannitol" is added directly at the beginning of the file name
